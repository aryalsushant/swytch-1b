## 📊 Overview

**Swytch 1B** is a building a comprehensive time-series forecasting system that predicts aerospace industry employment trends at both national and state levels. By combining official Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) employment data with macroeconomic indicators, we achieve state-of-the-art prediction accuracy to help job seekers, employers, and workforce planners make data-driven decisions.

### 🎯 Problem Statement

The aerospace industry experienced unprecedented volatility during 2020-2025, making workforce planning extremely challenging. Traditional forecasting methods struggle to account for:

- **COVID-19 impact** and recovery patterns  
- **Regional variations** in aerospace employment  
- **Economic indicators** influencing hiring decisions  
- **Seasonal patterns** in manufacturing employment  

### 💡 Our Solution

We developed a dual-model approach:

1. **ARIMA** for national-level trend forecasting  
2. **XGBoost** for state-level predictions with economic features  

This hybrid system provides both macro and micro insights into aerospace employment dynamics.
